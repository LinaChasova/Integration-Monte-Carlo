# Integration-Monte-Carlo

1. Implement your own ArrayList class, which supports size extension.

2. Use Monte Carlo method of integration to calculate the area of the polygon. 
(This require previously implemented method "point in polygon"). 
Set integration accuracy to 1e-4: if next iteration of Monte-Carlo simulation change area by less than 1e-4 - you must finish the loop. 

3. Write result rounded to 2 decimal digits after the point.   

Inside input.txt there are double coordinates of polygon like x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3.... Write area to output.txt
